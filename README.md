The final goal of this project was to make the visual of 4 Spotify pages:

- Login page
- Home page
- Artist page
- Album page

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- JAVASCRIPT
- Bootstrap

## Launch

To launch the web-site go to "link" and type in the login the following e-mail and password:

- **E-mail:** power-rangers@strive.com
- **Password:** bestteamever

Then once you are on the home page, there are two links in the footer beside the album picture. With these you can go between the two pages:

- Bohemian Rhapsody
- Queen

There is a link on the side Navbar "Home" that goes back to the Homepage.

Enjoy!
